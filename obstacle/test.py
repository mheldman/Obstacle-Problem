    Test for multigrid solver on Poisson equation (1)

            u_xx + u_yy = f   on Omega
            u(x, y) = g(x, y) on boundary Omega.

    This solver restrict Omega to the box region [x1, x2] x [y1, y2].

    Multigrid is an optimal iterative linear solver which solves a discretized PDE
    recursively on successively coarser grids to produce improved initial iterates
    for the fine grid problem.

    Parameters:

    bounds {tuple}:
    (x1, x2, y1, y2)
    Defines the region [x1, x2] x [y1, y2]

    f {callable}: rhs of u_xx + u_yy = f

    g {callable}:  boundary condition for solution u

    cycle {str}: cycling scheme for PFAS
    options: 'V' - v-cycle, 'W' - w-cycle, 'FV' - standard F-cycle
    'FW' - F-cycle + W-cycle, 'fmgV' - F-cycle beginning on coarsest grid
    (interpolates rhs down to coarse grid -- should start on coarse grid)

    Optional parameters:

    uexact {callable}: exact solution. Default is None.

    coarse_mx {int}: horizontal grid spacing on coarsest PFAS grid. Default is coarse_mx = 1.

    coarse_my {int}: vertical grid spacing on coarsest PFAS grid. Default is coarse_my = 1.

    min_num_levels, max_num_levels {int}: Solve problem max_num_levels - min_num_levels
    times on increasingly finer fine grids. Default is max_num_levels = min_num_levels + 1.

    Output:

    U {np.array}: Discrete fine grid solution of .

"""
Test for obstacle problem solver using PFAS. 
PFAS solves linear complementarity problems of the form (1):

u(x) >= 0               x in Omega
Lu(x) <= f(x)           x in Omega
u(x)[f(x) - Lu(x)] = 0  x in Omega
u(x) = g(x)             x on the boundary of Omega,

where L is a second-order elliptic operator.
This implementation restricts Omega to the square region [x1, x2] x [y1, y2].

A closely related problem is the obstacle problem (2):

u(x) >= psi(x)          x in Omega                    (2a)
Lu(x) <= f(x)           x in Omega                    (2b)
u(x)[f(x) - Lu(x)] = 0  x in Omega                    (2c)
u(x) = g(x)             x on the boundary of Omega,   (2d)

which can be put in form (1) via the transformation (3)

v(x) := u - psi
h(x) := f - Lu(x)
k(x) := g - psi

v(x) >= 0               x in Omega
Lv(x) <= h(x)           x in Omega
v(x)[h(x) - Lv(x)] = 0  x in Omega
v(x) = k(x)             x on the boundary of Omega.

This program solves the obstacle problem (2) on Omega = [x1, x2] x [y1, y2] by solving
the transformed problem (3) via PFAS.

Parameters:

bounds {tuple}: 
(x1, x2, y1, y2)
Defines the region Omega from (2) as Omega = [x1, x2] x [y1, y2]

f {callable}: rhs of (2b)

g {callable}  rhs of (2d)

psi {callable}: obstacle -- rhs of (2a)

cycle {str}: cycling scheme for PFAS
options: 'V' - v-cycle, 'W' - w-cycle, 'FV' - standard F-cycle
'FW' - F-cycle + W-cycle, 'fmgV' - F-cycle beginning on coarsest grid 
(interpolates rhs down to coarse grid -- should start on coarse grid)

uexact {callable}: exact solution of (2)

coarse_mx {int}: horizontal grid spacing on coarsest PFAS grid

coarse_my {int}: vertical grid spacing on coarsest PFAS grid

min_num_levels, max_num_levels {int}: Solve problem max_num_levels - min_num_levels
times on increasingly finer fine grids. Default is max_num_levels = min_num_levels + 1.

Output:

U {np.array}: Discrete fine grid solution vector of (2).
