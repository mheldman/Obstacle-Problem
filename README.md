# Obstacle-Problem

#### This repository contains codes designed to solve the obstacle problem.

#### The main items of interest are the multigrid.py and reducedspace.py files, which contain the two main solvers. The test.py file contains test programs, some of which are implemented in the files marked example, which in turn can be run from the commandline (or wherever is convenient).

#### I just realized today that this wasn't filled out, so if you tried to look at this directory (unlikely?) and were hopelessly confused, I am sorry! My old readme was more comprehensive, but the repository is sufficiently small that the comments in the .py files mentioned in the previous paragraph should do the trick. For now, I note to myself to add more here.
