# Obstacle-Problem

#### This repository contains codes designed to solve the obstacle problem.

#### The main items of interest are the multigrid.py and reducedspace.py files, which contain the two main solvers. The test.py file contains test programs, some of which are implemented in the files marked example, which in turn can be run from the commandline (or whereever is convenient).
